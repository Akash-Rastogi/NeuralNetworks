#The purpose of the this assignment is to practice with Hebbian learning rules.
 
<br/>Modify the program in previous assignment such that:
<br/>You can read the mnist data set as input
<br/>Create a button to select one of the three Hebbian rules from your textbook, i.e. "Filtered Learning", "Delta Rule", or "Unsupervised Hebb".
<br/>Create "Adjust Weights (Learn)" button such that each time that this button is pressed the appropriate Hebbian learning rule is applied.
<br/>Plot the error rate after each epoch on graph. An epoch is one pass over all the training samples. Make sure that your error-rate graph can display up to 1000 epochs.
<br/>Notes:
<br/>The index of the maximum value of the output vector is selected as the class id.
<br/>Make sure that you follow the submission guidelines to submit your code to Blackboard and your assignment can run on Python 2.7
